KeeBird is an extension for the [Thunderbird](https://thunderbird.net) email client
that communicates with the [KeePass Password Safe](https://keepass.info) to fill in
authentication information.

KeeBird is a fork of KeeFox 1.8. In the past, it was possible for the same extension
to work with both Firefox and Thunderbird, however with the shift to web
extensions in Firefox 57, it is no longer possible for the same extension to work
for both. Now, Kee 2.x is the extension for Firefox and KeeBird is the extension
for Thunderbird.
