<body>
<div>This is a page to assist in testing KeeFox features. Submitting a variety of inputs through this form while a KeePass database is open could help identify any unexpected issues or incomplete features.</div>
<br />
<div style="font-weight:bold">This page is an example of the most common login form structure: One username field and one password field. Although in this case, the username and password use an example of unusual field names and field ids.</div>
<br />
<div>Use the KeeFox toolbar and submit button below to test fill and save functionality. Note that the form just submits back to this page and performs no action.</div>
