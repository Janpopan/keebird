<title>KeeFox Test - Orphans with button</title>
</head>
<body>
<div>This is a page to assist in testing KeeFox features. Submitting a variety of inputs through this form while a KeePass database is open could help identify any unexpected issues or incomplete features.</div>
<br />
<div style="font-weight:bold">This page is an example of a pair of login fields which are not contained within a form. They have an orphaned submit button too which submits via Javascript although for this test, simply look for the appearance of an alert box indicating the submit function was called.</div>
<br />
<div>Use the KeeFox toolbar and submit button below to test fill and save functionality. Note that the form just submits to a test results page and performs no action on the submitted data.</div>
<br />
<label for="username">Username</label>: <input type="text" id="username" name="username" /><br />
<label for="password">Password</label>: <input type="password" id="password" name="password" /><br />
<br />
    <div role="button" onclick="javascript:alert('submitted')">Click me</div>
</body>
