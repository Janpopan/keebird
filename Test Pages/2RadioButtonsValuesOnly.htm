<body>
<div>This is a page to assist in testing KeeFox features. Submitting a variety of inputs through this form while a KeePass database is open could help identify any unexpected issues or incomplete features.</div>
<br />
<div style="font-weight:bold">This page is an example of: A password and two radio buttons with nothing to distinguish them except their values.</div>
<br />
<div>Use the KeeFox toolbar and submit button below to test fill and save functionality. Note that the form just submits to a test results page and performs no action on the submitted data.</div>
