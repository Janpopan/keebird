  KeeFox - Allows Firefox to communicate with KeePass (via the KeePassRPC KeePass plugin)
  Copyright 2008-2012 Chris Tomlinson <keefox@christomlinson.name>
  
  Configuration of KeeFox behaviour occurs in several places. This config
  file is the newest as of Oct 2012. Ultimately other configuration will be
  added to this config file, either directly or via abstractions to existing
  config data stores. For other configuration look to the standard Firefox
  preferences system and a keefox.sqlite file.
  Entry-specific configuration is stored in KeePass but in future maybe
  we'll still make it available from this interface.
