This information will often be disseminated onto the official KeeFox website in a more readable form but it serves as a useful reference to remind me what needs mentioning or if you are getting the latest SVN source code.

0.8.4
-----
- Installs KeePass 2.13 by default (doesn't upgrade existing KeePass 2.x installations)
- Refs #50 - No automatic login with multiple entries for the same URL (New hidden config option: autoFillFormsWithMultipleMatches)
- Fixes #43 - Show the "username" in the matched entries list rather than just in the tooltip
- Fixes #45 - Eliminate pull down menu when not appropriate
- Refs #56 - Display favicons for matched entries (only on child menu so far)
- KPRPC FindLogins now expects array of URLs to search for (can include just one URL in the array for existing behaviour)
- Now works (again) with databases that have no name
- Refs #25 - "Do you want KeeFox to save this password?" notification bar pops up when KeeFox has done all the form-filling itself (improved URL comparison)
- Finalised "Advanced strings" name format (old names can continue to be used but new docs will follow next beta release)
- New blocking URL "advanced strings" (docs to follow after next beta release)
- More work on currently hidden KeePass GUI features

0.8.3
-----
- Communication between KeeFox and KeePassRPC is now nearly all asynchronous;
- "Change database" file names truncated in more useful location whenever possible;
- Fill operation now triggered by selecting a login from the drop down box (no 2nd click on a button anymore);
- List of logins fully loaded during database changes - no more delays when navigating the Logins toolbar menu but longer delay before menu is updated;
- New icon cache in KeePassRPC speeds up Logins menu loading;
- Lots of work towards Firefox 4 support, most noteably removing reliance on FUEL since that's died an early death;

0.8.2
-----
- Removed some C# 3 syntax that upsets the PLGX compiler when running .NET 2.0

0.8.1
-----
- All synchronous requests from KeeFox to KeePassRPC will now timeout after 10 seconds so even crashed KeePassRPC requests cannot freeze Firefox for very long (or prevent it shutting down)

0.8
---
- A couple of little installer bug fixes that aren't likely be an issue until later builds
- Otherwise just a rebadged 0.77

0.77
----
- Workaround for probable Firefox bug regarding SSL negotiation callback timing and thread safety
- Installs KeePass 2.12 by default (doesn't upgrade existing KeePass 2.x installations)
- NTLM dialog autofill support - http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/keefox/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=50 (thanks to aheisner!)

0.76
----
- KeePassRPC replaces KeeICE
- New user welcome dialogs prettified
- Field references in usernames, passwords and other form fields (name, id and value) are now dereferenced before being sent from KeePass to KeeFox
- Fixes #14 (Provide quick way to utilise KeePass password generator from within Firefox)
- Fixes #32 (Add option to always open database from a fixed location)
- Fixes #36 (Support standard mouse button behavior) - left click opens login in same tab, middle click or ctrl-left-click opens it in new tab
- Logging is disabled when in Private Browsing mode
- Memory leaks removed
- A few options panel layout improvements
- Built-in Firefox password management setting stored (for later restortion when KeeFox uninstalled)
- SessionState configuration variable protected from changes that could break KeeFox
- Expiry date set to compensate for lack of automatic updates (0.7.6 expires at the end of July 2010 - a new version will be released before then, even if just to push the expiry time back a bit)
- File logging now put in a "keefox" directory inside your Firefox profile directory (used to be in the extension folder)
- Failed logging will no longer cause knock-on "random" problems
- KeeFoxElevate application created to aid with setup
- Installer now finds and focuses existing setup screen across all windows and tabs
- Sample password entries can be added to your database for use by the yet-to-exist KeeFox tutorial (added to new user's database automatically)
- New KeePassRPC "search" algorithm for finding matching passwords (speed-up is inversly proportional to number of entries in database; hundreds of times faster for smaller databases but only about twice as fast for one with 3000 entries - the latter is still a touch too slow for my liking but I think there are other reasons to not have a database that massive!)
- New advanced string allows regular expression matching on website domain name: "KeeFox URL Regex match"
- Logins now displayed in alphabetical order
- Installer triggers frantic connection attempts when KeePass is started for the first time (once every half a second for 15 seconds)
- SECURITY: Communication between Firefox and KeePass is protected by SSL encryption
- SECURITY: Multi-page login tracking is now safer (using JSON to track intermediate data between subsequent pages instead of eval)
- "Getting started" tutorial link added to new "Help" section on main menu
- New login favicons now re-use existing favicon if it is already in the KeePass database

0.73
----
- KeeICE upgrades detectable on KeePass startup from version 0.7.3 onwards
- New user welcome dialogs prototyped
- Fixes #19 (Allow opt-in/opt-out on an entry-by-entry basis for auto-submittal)
- Fixes #23 (KeeFox should have an option to turn password save prompts off entirely)
- Fixes #11 (Add option to not save KeePass database automatically)
- New KeeFox Options Menu added to KeePass
- Fixes #2 (Choose a KeePass sub-group to treat as the root group for KeeFox integration)

0.72
----
- Fixes #13 (Allow password entries to be given priority weightings)
- Improved matched login toolbar button to work more reliably with sites that contain sub-frames on their log-in pages (e.g. facebook.com)
- Fixes #3 (Hidden option to adjust ICE connection timeout) but beware, changes in this area can make things a bit unstable and it's not well tested yet. Please report all issues you encounter.

0.71
----
- Removed black background on logins menu that is active in some currently unknown circumstances
- Fixed #20
- Manual and "advanced" form detection now scans for forms in all frames on a page

0.7
---
- "Welcome to KeeFox" now works properly with KeePass 2.09
- Installer now looks pretty, some installation options still need a bit of work though
- Toolbar buttons have new icons
- Simplified and improved the text for some parts of the install process
- Added support for NTLM proxy authentication password auto-fill / auto-submit
- New icon
- Refinements to multi-page login tracking and filling
- Form submissions now simulate a "click" on the form's submit button (if one can be found)
- Username now displayed on tooltip of entries listed in the full list of Log-ins
- KeeICE now uses the .plgx plugin format, permitting simpler upgrade procedures
- favicons automatically added to KeePass entry when a new entry is saved
- KeePass icons now displayed alongside login and group titles
- Entry location displayed in matched login tooltip
- "no username" placeholder added to tooltips of matched logins with no username
- Now requires KeePass 2.09
- Tidied the layout of the toolbar
- Added button to manually detect forms on the current page (useful on pages such as live.com)
- Form filling now only fills each field in the entry into one form field on the page (it's still impossible to predict the correct field in every situation but this at least reduces annoyance if KeeFox guesses incorrectly)
- Session tab variables that track multi-page logins are now reset when user is viewing any page that is not at the top of the Firefox history stack. Ditto when the tab's domain is changed.
- "not now" button works again
- removed the "(with options)" button on password save. It's only use so far is chosing a group to save the password in and that won't quite be ready for the 0.7 release.
- Created new pages to test forms within frames
- A few bug fixes to improve login and form matching
- Initial work on upgrade walkthrough process
- Worked around a multiple-window bug. Every window registers a form submission listener and should unregister when the window closes. I haven't worked out how to do that yet so in the meantime I have put a quick test in place to at least keep everything working correctly, albeit with a probable memory leak.
- KeePass entries without username and password form meta-data "advanced" strings can now be read by KeeFox
- HTTP(S) protocol authentication dialog boxes can be filled (no password saving yet - manually add a "Form HTTP realm" advanced string to an existing KeePass login to make it work, and make sure the URL field is correct too)
- Built-in Firefox password saving disabled
- Refactored logging statements into a seperate library and added related options (no GUI yet)
- Fixed several stability bugs
- Fixed several types of form / situation that behaved incorrectly
- Added hidden option to configure local TCP port used for ICE link between Firefox and KeePass
- Improved testing system, including a variety of test HTML pages to aid manual quality control before official releases.
- Reduced number of threads required by the ICE connection routine and squashed some concurrency / deadlock bugs
- Multiple page logins
- Multiple other fields per form (text, radio, checkbox, select)
- Multiple passwords per form
- Minimum Firefox version raised to 3.06 due to bug in <= 3.05 (KeeFox should still work in those browsers but it won't install as easily)
- Now requires KeePass 2.08
- Active database can be changed from within Firefox (choose from any of KeePass' most recently used databases)
- Delete from Firefox now puts the entry into the recycle bin (if configured by user in KeePass) or provides a warning. However...
- Delete from Firefox option removed due to interface imperfections - can't risk confusion with something like this.
- Started tidying some code - e.g. lots of documentation comments and removing commented code secions I now know will be of no use.
- Added support for multiple URL matches with one login (a pre-requesite of multi-page login pages but may also be useful for sites such as live.com / hotmail.com). There is no Firefox interface to configure manual URL equivelances - just edit the custom space-seperated string in KeePass. (spaces in URLs must be correctly encoded to + or %20)
- Changed the preliminary website domain to keefox.org becuase that is now available and it will help users spot that it is not the same as keepass.info. There shouldn't be anyone using keefox.info but I'll redirect any relevant requests for a while just in case.
