This information will often be disseminated onto the official KeeFox website in a more readable form but it serves as a useful reference to remind me what needs mentioning or if you are getting the latest SVN source code.

0.8.19
------
Fix for filling entries with missing or inaccurate ids and names
Fix for HTTP Auth URL detection (rarely worked in 0.8.17/18)
Add-on description changed for UK users

0.8.18
------
Fix for forms with fieldset elements

0.8.17
------
HTML5 form input types no longer ignored
No longer prompts to save password if KeePass is not connected (still does when logged out... at least for now)
Double clicking on a form field or url entry in the KeeFox tab in the KeePass "edit entry" dialog now opens the appropriate edit window
Password fields created through the form field editor were never stored with in-memory protection and existing protected fields could not be edited
KPRPC: No longer try to close databases that are already closed when changing database via KeeFox
HTTP Auth dialogs now read URL from parent window for more accurate entry matching
Unicode characters now stored and read in Firefox preferences system correctly. Fixes #88

0.8.15
------
Fixed: Some other Firefox dialogs were broken when KeeFox was installed
KeePass 2.15 set as default version to install for new users
Improved password field matching
HTTP Auth dialogs now respect global and site-specific "prompt to save password" settings

0.8.12
------
HTTPAuth logins now respect the entries auto-fill/submit preferences;
HTTPAuth logins can be "one-click"ed from the Logins menu;
HTTPAuth dialogs now report when 0 passwords are found;
HTTPAuth dialogs now prompt to save password (using main domain URL only - maybe could use parent window URL in future...);
Fixes #84 : Setup process displays a warning to close KeePass if an installation is detected on the PC (regardless of whether it's open or not);
Installing KeeFox sample entries no longer crashes KeePass when no DB is active;
User is now warned if KeeFox samples group already exists in a hidden part of the DB;
fixed (actually in rev 104): another situation where entries could be incorrectly treated as different on submit when in fact they match an existing login (not convinced this particular situation arises much in the real world);
HTTP Auth dialogs now work again in FF3.6;
Conditional addition of KeePass sample entries actually works now;
now only guess correct form field by type if it is a text field (other types must have been entered into the KeePass entry anyway so should have a name in most cases and this will avoid some false positives);
field names were being sent from KeePassRPC with incorrect values, leading to innaccurate form field matching;
hostname matching is now case-insensitive;
Fixed: older "Alternative URLs" did not always appear in the "URLs" tab in the "edit entry" KeePass entry tab;

0.8.9
-----
changed URL weighting in form fill algorithm;
Added KeeFox help centre link to help menu;
Title of login added to HTTP Auth tooltips;
Logins with matching realm given priority for auto-filling HTTP Auth, etc.;
KeeFox icon added to some KPRPC dialogs (in absense of KPRPC icon to use);
tidied up a few comments
CheckForAdminRights application now runs as a Windows app rather than DOS so there's no longer a brief flash of a command window during initial install;
Fixed: Auto-submitting logins to HTTP Auth (etc.) dialog boxes causes parent window to close;
KeePass 2.14 set as default download now;
installer can be restarted now without restarting Firefox;
Canceling a download displays a message as well as the "restart" button;
Failed download checksum displays a message and presents a "retry" button;
various installation stages did not proceed automatically - now they do;
initiating the download of the KeePass ZIP file or .NET 3.5 installer now triggers the KeePass setup exe or .NET 2 installer to stop downloading;
Extra links to help resources added to various parts of the installer (now I just need to create the resources!);
Completed setup process now suggests two "next steps" to get new users up and running ASAP;
Fixed: regular polling for new/changed forms caused a "flashing" effect while the matched logins menu was wiped clear and then re-populated with new matches;
Logins from multiple subframes and dynamically created forms (if appropriate option set) now get appended to existing list of matched logins rather than replacing what was already there;
removed some more event listeners (possible memory leak fix?);
initial SQL setup commands no longer execute async - proved too unreliable and we do only do it the once but still it's a bit ick;
changing log settings, dynamic form scanning and KeePass location can now be done without restarting Firefox;
KeePass entry dialog editor KeeFox tab now split into three subtabs to make it feel less cramped;
An entry's realm can now be set through the KeeFox tab in KeePass;
Group settings (i.e. just whether it's the KeeFox home/root group at the moment) are now qualified by location;
New location manager added to KeePassRPC;
No longer overwrite default KeeFox home group with that from a specific location (maybe the underlying cause of a couple of odd bugs?);
Installer no longer overwrites existing KeePass installations when custom (or non administrator) installation is performed;

0.8.7
-----
- Instruction added to HTTP Auth (etc.) dialog box when KeePass is not logged in
- Tidied up some event and observer listener additions and removals (possible memory leak removal?)
- Now track JSON-RPC request Ids so temporary storage items can be removed explicitly (rather than hoping GC will do it; possible memory leak removal?)
- Fill/submit from matched logins menu now searches all forms and finds the "best" rather than "first"
- Matched login menu no longer cleared when generating new password
- Log messages have current time prefixed on them
- Fixed HTTP auth dialog box support in FF4
- Fixed a couple of bugs related to URL matching and fixed the RegEx evaluation problem
- URL evaluation much more strict but only when user includes a new "KPRPC Block hostname-only match" advanced string, otherwise they'll hopefully just be more accurate
- KeePassRPC popup dialogs are now centered on parent window
- Save entries straight into a sub group
- Fixes #24 - Add 'Never for this site' button to the KeeFox remeber this site notification bar
- Fixes #63 - Update KeeFox options window

0.8.5
-----
- Target platform relaxed to include any WINNT CPU architecture
- Refs #53 - Some Firefox 4 fixes

- Logins can now be edited from the right-click / context menu on the matched login menu or button
- Fixes #45 - Eliminate pull down menu when not appropriate
- Location based configuration now stores current location in KeePass config file
- Fixes #56 - Display favicons for matched entries
- Fixes #54 - GUI options for Entry and Group added
- KeePassRPC made less specific to KeeFox RPC client

0.8.4
-----
- Installs KeePass 2.13 by default (doesn't upgrade existing KeePass 2.x installations)
- Refs #50 - No automatic login with multiple entries for the same URL (New hidden config option: autoFillFormsWithMultipleMatches)
- Fixes #43 - Show the "username" in the matched entries list rather than just in the tooltip
- Refs #45 - Eliminate pull down menu when not appropriate (button doesn't work yet but probably nearly done)
- Refs #56 - Display favicons for matched entries (only on child menu so far)
- KPRPC FindLogins now expects array of URLs to search for (can include just one URL in the array for existing behaviour)
- Now works (again) with databases that have no name
- Refs #25 - "Do you want KeeFox to save this password?" notification bar pops up when KeeFox has done all the form-filling itself (improved URL comparison)
- Finalised "Advanced strings" name format (old names can continue to be used but new docs will follow next beta release)
- New blocking URL "advanced strings" (docs to follow after next beta release)
- More work on currently hidden KeePass GUI features

0.8.3
-----
- Communication between KeeFox and KeePassRPC is now nearly all asynchronous;
- "Change database" file names truncated in more useful location whenever possible;
- Fill operation now triggered by selecting a login from the drop down box (no 2nd click on a button anymore);
- List of logins fully loaded during database changes - no more delays when navigating the Logins toolbar menu but longer delay before menu is updated;
- New icon cache in KeePassRPC speeds up Logins menu loading;
- Lots of work towards Firefox 4 support, most noteably removing reliance on FUEL since that's died an early death;

0.8.2
-----
- Removed some C# 3 syntax that upsets the PLGX compiler when running .NET 2.0

0.8.1
-----
- All synchronous requests from KeeFox to KeePassRPC will now timeout after 10 seconds so even crashed KeePassRPC requests cannot freeze Firefox for very long (or prevent it shutting down)

0.8
---
- A couple of little installer bug fixes that aren't likely be an issue until later builds
- Otherwise just a rebadged 0.77

0.77
----
- Workaround for probable Firefox bug regarding SSL negotiation callback timing and thread safety
- Installs KeePass 2.12 by default (doesn't upgrade existing KeePass 2.x installations)
- NTLM dialog autofill support - http://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/keefox/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=50 (thanks to aheisner!)

0.76
----
- KeePassRPC replaces KeeICE
- New user welcome dialogs prettified
- Field references in usernames, passwords and other form fields (name, id and value) are now dereferenced before being sent from KeePass to KeeFox
- Fixes #14 (Provide quick way to utilise KeePass password generator from within Firefox)
- Fixes #32 (Add option to always open database from a fixed location)
- Fixes #36 (Support standard mouse button behavior) - left click opens login in same tab, middle click or ctrl-left-click opens it in new tab
- Logging is disabled when in Private Browsing mode
- Memory leaks removed
- A few options panel layout improvements
- Built-in Firefox password management setting stored (for later restortion when KeeFox uninstalled)
- SessionState configuration variable protected from changes that could break KeeFox
- Expiry date set to compensate for lack of automatic updates (0.7.6 expires at the end of July 2010 - a new version will be released before then, even if just to push the expiry time back a bit)
- File logging now put in a "keefox" directory inside your Firefox profile directory (used to be in the extension folder)
- Failed logging will no longer cause knock-on "random" problems
- KeeFoxElevate application created to aid with setup
- Installer now finds and focuses existing setup screen across all windows and tabs
- Sample password entries can be added to your database for use by the yet-to-exist KeeFox tutorial (added to new user's database automatically)
- New KeePassRPC "search" algorithm for finding matching passwords (speed-up is inversly proportional to number of entries in database; hundreds of times faster for smaller databases but only about twice as fast for one with 3000 entries - the latter is still a touch too slow for my liking but I think there are other reasons to not have a database that massive!)
- New advanced string allows regular expression matching on website domain name: "KeeFox URL Regex match"
- Logins now displayed in alphabetical order
- Installer triggers frantic connection attempts when KeePass is started for the first time (once every half a second for 15 seconds)
- SECURITY: Communication between Firefox and KeePass is protected by SSL encryption
- SECURITY: Multi-page login tracking is now safer (using JSON to track intermediate data between subsequent pages instead of eval)
- "Getting started" tutorial link added to new "Help" section on main menu
- New login favicons now re-use existing favicon if it is already in the KeePass database

0.73
----
- KeeICE upgrades detectable on KeePass startup from version 0.7.3 onwards
- New user welcome dialogs prototyped
- Fixes #19 (Allow opt-in/opt-out on an entry-by-entry basis for auto-submittal)
- Fixes #23 (KeeFox should have an option to turn password save prompts off entirely)
- Fixes #11 (Add option to not save KeePass database automatically)
- New KeeFox Options Menu added to KeePass
- Fixes #2 (Choose a KeePass sub-group to treat as the root group for KeeFox integration)

0.72
----
- Fixes #13 (Allow password entries to be given priority weightings)
- Improved matched login toolbar button to work more reliably with sites that contain sub-frames on their log-in pages (e.g. facebook.com)
- Fixes #3 (Hidden option to adjust ICE connection timeout) but beware, changes in this area can make things a bit unstable and it's not well tested yet. Please report all issues you encounter.

0.71
----
- Removed black background on logins menu that is active in some currently unknown circumstances
- Fixed #20
- Manual and "advanced" form detection now scans for forms in all frames on a page

0.7
---
- "Welcome to KeeFox" now works properly with KeePass 2.09
- Installer now looks pretty, some installation options still need a bit of work though
- Toolbar buttons have new icons
- Simplified and improved the text for some parts of the install process
- Added support for NTLM proxy authentication password auto-fill / auto-submit
- New icon
- Refinements to multi-page login tracking and filling
- Form submissions now simulate a "click" on the form's submit button (if one can be found)
- Username now displayed on tooltip of entries listed in the full list of Log-ins
- KeeICE now uses the .plgx plugin format, permitting simpler upgrade procedures
- favicons automatically added to KeePass entry when a new entry is saved
- KeePass icons now displayed alongside login and group titles
- Entry location displayed in matched login tooltip
- "no username" placeholder added to tooltips of matched logins with no username
- Now requires KeePass 2.09
- Tidied the layout of the toolbar
- Added button to manually detect forms on the current page (useful on pages such as live.com)
- Form filling now only fills each field in the entry into one form field on the page (it's still impossible to predict the correct field in every situation but this at least reduces annoyance if KeeFox guesses incorrectly)
- Session tab variables that track multi-page logins are now reset when user is viewing any page that is not at the top of the Firefox history stack. Ditto when the tab's domain is changed.
- "not now" button works again
- removed the "(with options)" button on password save. It's only use so far is chosing a group to save the password in and that won't quite be ready for the 0.7 release.
- Created new pages to test forms within frames
- A few bug fixes to improve login and form matching
- Initial work on upgrade walkthrough process
- Worked around a multiple-window bug. Every window registers a form submission listener and should unregister when the window closes. I haven't worked out how to do that yet so in the meantime I have put a quick test in place to at least keep everything working correctly, albeit with a probable memory leak.
- KeePass entries without username and password form meta-data "advanced" strings can now be read by KeeFox
- HTTP(S) protocol authentication dialog boxes can be filled (no password saving yet - manually add a "Form HTTP realm" advanced string to an existing KeePass login to make it work, and make sure the URL field is correct too)
- Built-in Firefox password saving disabled
- Refactored logging statements into a seperate library and added related options (no GUI yet)
- Fixed several stability bugs
- Fixed several types of form / situation that behaved incorrectly
- Added hidden option to configure local TCP port used for ICE link between Firefox and KeePass
- Improved testing system, including a variety of test HTML pages to aid manual quality control before official releases.
- Reduced number of threads required by the ICE connection routine and squashed some concurrency / deadlock bugs
- Multiple page logins
- Multiple other fields per form (text, radio, checkbox, select)
- Multiple passwords per form
- Minimum Firefox version raised to 3.06 due to bug in <= 3.05 (KeeFox should still work in those browsers but it won't install as easily)
- Now requires KeePass 2.08
- Active database can be changed from within Firefox (choose from any of KeePass' most recently used databases)
- Delete from Firefox now puts the entry into the recycle bin (if configured by user in KeePass) or provides a warning. However...
- Delete from Firefox option removed due to interface imperfections - can't risk confusion with something like this.
- Started tidying some code - e.g. lots of documentation comments and removing commented code secions I now know will be of no use.
- Added support for multiple URL matches with one login (a pre-requesite of multi-page login pages but may also be useful for sites such as live.com / hotmail.com). There is no Firefox interface to configure manual URL equivelances - just edit the custom space-seperated string in KeePass. (spaces in URLs must be correctly encoded to + or %20)
- Changed the preliminary website domain to keefox.org becuase that is now available and it will help users spot that it is not the same as keepass.info. There shouldn't be anyone using keefox.info but I'll redirect any relevant requests for a while just in case.
