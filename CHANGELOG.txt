This information will often be disseminated onto the official KeeFox website in a more readable form but it serves as a useful reference to remind me what needs mentioning or if you are getting the latest SVN source code.

0.76
----
- KeePassRPC replaces KeeICE

0.73
----
- KeeICE upgrades detectable on KeePass startup from version 0.7.3 onwards
- New user welcome dialogs prototyped
- Fixes #19 (Allow opt-in/opt-out on an entry-by-entry basis for auto-submittal)

0.72
----
- Fixes #13 (Allow password entries to be given priority weightings)
- Improved matched login toolbar button to work more reliably with sites that contain sub-frames on their log-in pages (e.g. facebook.com)
- Fixes #3 (Hidden option to adjust ICE connection timeout) but beware, changes in this area can make things a bit unstable and it's not well tested yet. Please report all issues you encounter.

0.71
----
- Removed black background on logins menu that is active in some currently unknown circumstances
- Fixed #20
- Manual and "advanced" form detection now scans for forms in all frames on a page

0.7
---
- "Welcome to KeeFox" now works properly with KeePass 2.09
- Installer now looks pretty, some installation options still need a bit of work though
- Toolbar buttons have new icons
- Simplified and improved the text for some parts of the install process
- Added support for NTLM proxy authentication password auto-fill / auto-submit
- New icon
- Refinements to multi-page login tracking and filling
- Form submissions now simulate a "click" on the form's submit button (if one can be found)
- Username now displayed on tooltip of entries listed in the full list of Log-ins
- KeeICE now uses the .plgx plugin format, permitting simpler upgrade procedures
- favicons automatically added to KeePass entry when a new entry is saved
- KeePass icons now displayed alongside login and group titles
- Entry location displayed in matched login tooltip
- "no username" placeholder added to tooltips of matched logins with no username
- Now requires KeePass 2.09
- Tidied the layout of the toolbar
- Added button to manually detect forms on the current page (useful on pages such as live.com)
- Form filling now only fills each field in the entry into one form field on the page (it's still impossible to predict the correct field in every situation but this at least reduces annoyance if KeeFox guesses incorrectly)
- Session tab variables that track multi-page logins are now reset when user is viewing any page that is not at the top of the Firefox history stack. Ditto when the tab's domain is changed.
- "not now" button works again
- removed the "(with options)" button on password save. It's only use so far is chosing a group to save the password in and that won't quite be ready for the 0.7 release.
- Created new pages to test forms within frames
- A few bug fixes to improve login and form matching
- Initial work on upgrade walkthrough process
- Worked around a multiple-window bug. Every window registers a form submission listener and should unregister when the window closes. I haven't worked out how to do that yet so in the meantime I have put a quick test in place to at least keep everything working correctly, albeit with a probable memory leak.
- KeePass entries without username and password form meta-data "advanced" strings can now be read by KeeFox
- HTTP(S) protocol authentication dialog boxes can be filled (no password saving yet - manually add a "Form HTTP realm" advanced string to an existing KeePass login to make it work, and make sure the URL field is correct too)
- Built-in Firefox password saving disabled
- Refactored logging statements into a seperate library and added related options (no GUI yet)
- Fixed several stability bugs
- Fixed several types of form / situation that behaved incorrectly
- Added hidden option to configure local TCP port used for ICE link between Firefox and KeePass
- Improved testing system, including a variety of test HTML pages to aid manual quality control before official releases.
- Reduced number of threads required by the ICE connection routine and squashed some concurrency / deadlock bugs
- Multiple page logins
- Multiple other fields per form (text, radio, checkbox, select)
- Multiple passwords per form
- Minimum Firefox version raised to 3.06 due to bug in <= 3.05 (KeeFox should still work in those browsers but it won't install as easily)
- Now requires KeePass 2.08
- Active database can be changed from within Firefox (choose from any of KeePass' most recently used databases)
- Delete from Firefox now puts the entry into the recycle bin (if configured by user in KeePass) or provides a warning. However...
- Delete from Firefox option removed due to interface imperfections - can't risk confusion with something like this.
- Started tidying some code - e.g. lots of documentation comments and removing commented code secions I now know will be of no use.
- Added support for multiple URL matches with one login (a pre-requesite of multi-page login pages but may also be useful for sites such as live.com / hotmail.com). There is no Firefox interface to configure manual URL equivelances - just edit the custom space-seperated string in KeePass. (spaces in URLs must be correctly encoded to + or %20)
- Changed the preliminary website domain to keefox.org becuase that is now available and it will help users spot that it is not the same as keepass.info. There shouldn't be anyone using keefox.info but I'll redirect any relevant requests for a while just in case.
